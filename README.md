## About
AlwaysPickCoinPurse is a mod for the videogame Vampire Survivors which skips the level-up screen that appears when leveling up with maxed out weapons and passives and always picks the Coin Purse option instead, allowing for uninterrupted and seamless gameplay in high-level runs.

This mod will become obsolete with the release of patch v0.8.0, which is scheduled to be released on July 7th, 2022.

## Installing the mod
1. Download the file `main.bundle.js` from the [GitHub releases page](/../../releases).
2. Open Windows Explorer and browse to the Vampire Survivors folder.
3. Navigate to the subfolder `resources`, then `app`, then `.webpack` and finally `renderer` and rename the file `main.bundle.js` to `main.bundle.js.bak`.
4. Copy the `main.bundle.js` file you downloaded from this repository into the `renderer` folder.
