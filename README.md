## About
AlwaysPickCoinPurse is a mod for the videogame Vampire Survivors which skips the level-up screen that appears when leveling up with maxed out weapons and passives and always picks the Coin Purse option instead, allowing for uninterrupted and seamless gameplay in high-level runs.

This mod has become obsolete with the [release of patch v0.8.0](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3323108691076674105).

## Installing the mod
1. Download the file `main.bundle.js` from the [GitHub releases page](/../../releases).
2. Open Windows Explorer and browse to the Vampire Survivors folder.
3. Navigate to the subfolder `resources`, then `app`, then `.webpack` and finally `renderer` and rename the file `main.bundle.js` to `main.bundle.js.bak`.
4. Copy the `main.bundle.js` file you downloaded from this repository into the `renderer` folder.
